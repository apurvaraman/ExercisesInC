Team formation for our team was pretty straightforward; in the exercise we did in class we all ended up consistently in the same "petals". We all have an interest in learning about more about operating systems and how they work. We shared our goals and things we were interested in during this exercise, so that was helpful. We decided that the scrum master was Joey because he volunteered and made the Trello board. 

When we started making the backlog, we were unsure whether our work for the sprint was expected to happen with a project idea already concretely decided, so we came to our sprint planning meeting with some project ideas. We were able to narrow down the list of possible projects, but struggled to tell whether we were choosing things of appropriate scope. Therefore, we had a lot of general things in our backlog that could be applied to any of the projects. After talking in class and getting a better sense of what this sprint should look like, we were able to make more concrete plans and turn some of our vague ideas into things that had a clear definition of done.

I am a little apprehensive about the project and teaming in general because I'm still unsure how my workload and schedule will be this semester.
